# End-to-End Data Engineering Solution

This documentation outlines an end-to-end data engineering project that streamlines data processing and visualization through the following steps:

1. **Data Import**: Import data into on-premise SQL Server to ensure integrity and accessibility.
2. **Data Transfer**: Use Azure Data Factory to copy data from on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Gen2 for scalable storage.
3. **Data Transformation**: Utilize Azure Databricks to transform raw data into a clean, structured format.
4. **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying and analysis.
5. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize insights derived from the data.

This project integrates various cloud technologies to enhance data accessibility and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time analytics.
